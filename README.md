# 🧹 Data Cleaning & 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

This repository contains two beginner-friendly data science projects where I practiced **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python.

---

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Patient Dataset – Data Cleaning
- Worked on a healthcare dataset to understand the importance of **data preprocessing**.
- Tasks performed:
  - Handling missing values
  - Correcting inconsistent data types
  - Standardizing column names
  - Removing duplicates

**Skills practiced:** Data cleaning, preprocessing, handling nulls, ensuring consistency.

### 2️⃣ Titanic Dataset – EDA
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the classic Titanic dataset.
- Tasks performed:
  - Analyzing survival patterns based on **gender, class, and age**
  - Feature engineering (`family_size`, `individual_fare`)
  - Visualizing data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
  - Studying correlations with a **heatmap**

**Key Insights:**
- Higher-class passengers had better survival chances.
- Fare positively correlated with survival.
- Family size strongly correlated with `SibSp` and `Parch`.
